Right — earlier we discussed using colors grounded in student psychology to make
Aedura’s interface both trustworthy and cognitively stimulating, without overstimulation or
fatigue.

balance (ideal for both light and dark themes):

Would you like me to also design a color system layout (like a palette board + component
usage guide) for your frontend team — showing exactly which colors to use where (buttons,
navbar, background, cards, etc.)?
It would make Varad’s landing page design much faster and consistent.
